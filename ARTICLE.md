# What I find most interesting about the article is
how it shows that AI isn’t replacing developers, but instead reshaping their roles into something more creative and strategic. I like the idea that engineers can spend less time on repetitive coding and more on designing systems, making decisions, and ensuring ethical use of technology. It’s also fascinating to see real-world examples, like startups with nearly all AI-generated code, which makes me think about how quickly the field is evolving and how important adaptability will be for future developers.

This was a pretty detailed article and I enjoyed reading it. A couple things stood out:

> Many developers are changing their code editors every six months

I am not sure if this claim is true, would have been nice to see it substantiated.

> Of the latest startup batch funded by Y Combinator, a major technology venture capital firm, a quarter have 95% of their codebases generated by AI.

This claim too is surprising to me that an end to end prototype can be done almost fully using AI tech. Some references here too would have been nice by the authors.
