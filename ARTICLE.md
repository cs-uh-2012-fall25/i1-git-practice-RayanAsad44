# What I find most interesting about the article is how it shows that AI isn’t replacing developers, but instead reshaping their roles into something more creative and strategic. I like the idea that engineers can spend less time on repetitive coding and more on designing systems, making decisions, and ensuring ethical use of technology. It’s also fascinating to see real-world examples, like startups with nearly all AI-generated code, which makes me think about how quickly the field is evolving and how important adaptability will be for future developers.
